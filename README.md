## Why should you pick Ordle?
Because you deserve Wordle without the bloat, bugs, or bogus words.

## Why did I create this?
Simple: All of the alternatives suck A LOT. The best option (after this one) would be 'Wordle!' by 'Lion Studios Plus'. But that game is bloated (271MB!) adware that is also pay to win.

P.S.
Can we take a moment of silence for the 271MB that 'Wordle!' took up on my and other people's devices? According to Google Play it has 10+M downloads. That's at least 2.6 Petabytes of data... It's Wordle and not Baldur's Gate 3...
